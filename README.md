*Gameplay shows the kart is chasing the puck and trying to hit it to the goal. Red point is puck position prediction, Green is puck position ground truth*

## Project Description:

For this project. We are asked to build controllers that would win a 2v2 hockey game against other AI players. Gameplay was done in a modified racing simulator built on SuperTuxKart.
The main goal of the game is to control the kart to hit the puck to the opposite goal.
